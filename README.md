# INTSEC-HT2024 Challenges

Welcome to the **INTSEC-HT2024** repository! This repository contains solutions to all the challenges presented in the course "Introduction to Security" (HT2024) of Stockholm University. Below, you will find a detailed breakdown of the challenges and their corresponding solutions, organized by lecture.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- Each lecture has its own directory (e.g., `Lecture0`, `Lecture1`, etc.).
- Inside each directory, you will find subdirectories or files corresponding to the challenges (e.g., `Challenge0.1`, `Challenge1.2`, etc.).
- Supplementary files (e.g., scripts, PDFs, or test cases) are included where necessary.
